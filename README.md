![03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40577712/110861656-72eb7d00-828c-11eb-80f0-2d586bb2773c.png)
1. Click the **X** button in the top-right corner
1. Select **Play** in the launcher
1. Once in-game CTRL+click the Settings button (bottom-left corner by default)
1. Change your settings to match the image below:  
![InGameSettings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40577712/112235704-8f38d380-8c15-11eb-9791-fddfe493d45b.png)
1. Close the Settings window by right-clicking in the title bar (anywhere along the bar that says "Settings")

   1. If you don't have a numpad change `Reload Config:          VK_NUMPAD0` in ProjectDiablo.cfg (in your PD2 folder) to one of these [Virtual Key Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)

If it worked a Minor Health Potion should now say *HP1*.

# Loot Filters  
### [ElPocoBurrito's BTNeandertha1 fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/btneandertha1.filter)  
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.  
This is a tweaked version of Wolfie's BTNeadertha1 loot filter. It will only contain features that i want for myself, as it is primarily made for my personal use. I will happily provide fixes if anything is broken and if you want help or have any questions, you are more than welcome to ping me in PD2's #lootfilter channel or send me a DM at ElPocoBurrito#0001 on discord.

Original description by Wolfie:
This is a custom-made version for [BTNeandertha1](https://www.twitch.tv/btneandertha1) which is quite strict. No support will be given for this version.

# Discord
Please dont ask Wolfie for help about my filter in his discord. Either ask for help in #lootfilter or to me directly.

# Donations
If you like my filter and wish to donate, i'd recommend you donate to Wolfie instead, not me, as a large portion of this filter is from him and he does alot of work to help everyone on PD2 by managing filters. Here is a link to his GitHub where you can find his donation links: [Github - Donation links](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/lodfilter)

# Common Issues
These are the common problems that people seem to run into. Please check each of these before asking for help.
* In-game settings not matching what I have in [Installation](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter#installation)
* Having two PD2 installations and pasting your filter into the wrong one
* Saving the filter file with the wrong name, eg **default.filter.filter**, **default.txt**, or **default.filter.txt**
* Having a PD2 installation inside of a Diablo II folder which is inside another Diablo II folder (folderception!)
* Not saving and closing the filter file after pasting into it

# FAQ
**Read the [Common Issues](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter#common-issues) above if the FAQ does not help.**

1. **What is the (best / recommended / good for X / leveling) filter?**
   * "Best" / "recommended" is subjective. The best/recommended filter is the filter that suits your needs! Try a few out, it's easier than ever now to try different ones as it's only a few clicks in the launcher. [List of Public Filters](https://projectdiablo2.miraheze.org/wiki/Item_Filtering#List_of_Public_Filters) has a short description for each filter
1. **How do I turn off the filter / go back to original?**
   * Turn off `Enable Loot Filter` in the in-game settings then close your game and launcher. Delete the `filters` folder, and delete `default.filter` and `loot.filter` in the ProjectD2 folder, and then reload the game
1. **My launcher still says "Coming soon!" for item filters?**
   * First back-up your ddraw.ini and ProjectDiablo.cfg files (these will be overwritten). Visit the [Project Diablo 2](https://www.projectdiablo2.com/) site and download the launcher and install the new launcher version
1. **How do I use a filter with PlugY?**
   * Open the launcher, pick a filter, hit Play & let the game open. Close the game, close the launcher, and open PlugY. **NOTE:** you should open the launcher and repeat this process every few days to get game and filter updates
1. **My Settings button is gone?**
   * Close the game & the launcher, delete `UI.ini`, and then relaunch the game. Note you may have to redo your settings (look at the image in [Installation](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter#installation))
1. **I've customized my filter, how do I save my changes?**
   * **NOTE:** Using a local filter will mean you miss out on updates from the creator whose filter you're using. You will have to manually input any future changes they make to acquire them. Put your customized filter into `ProjectD2\filters\local` as `default.filter` and choose "Local" in the launcher (look at my guide [here](https://github.com/Project-Diablo-2/LootFilters#using-a-local--customized-filter) too)
1. **I want to use a filter not in the launcher?**
   * **NOTE:** Using a local filter will mean you miss out on updates from the creator whose filter you're using. You will have to manually input any future changes they make to acquire them. Put your customized filter into `ProjectD2\filters\local` as `default.filter` and choose "Local" in the launcher (look at my guide [here](https://github.com/Project-Diablo-2/LootFilters#using-a-local--customized-filter) too)
1. **Will a loot filter from a previous Season work for this Season?**
   * No. Each season has added new items, changed all the map item codes, and more. You will most likely miss out on all of these things if you continue using a filter that is not updated for the newest season
1. **My launcher shows no filters in the list?**
   * Close launcher and re-open, repeat if they still don't show *or* the server/GitHub is down. Also try adding the launcher and game to your antivirus and/or firewall
1. **Has anyone made a video or post about the differences between X and Y filter?**
   * No one here has made comparison videos or a post of "X vs Y filter", that would be an astronomical amount of work. What's not a lot of work is trying a few out and seeing what fits your style!
1. **How can I test my chosen loot filter?**
   * The easiest way to test your filter is by using [BetweenWall's FilterBird](https://betweenwalls.github.io/filterbird/?v=PD2)
1. **Are your filters updated for the newest Season?**
   * Yes, all versions of my filters are updated and ready-to-go for the newest Season!
1. **What is the difference between your filters?**
   * Vanilla is zero strictness, Detailed/Revealed are less strict, Wolfie is stricter, and BT is strictest

# Extras  
### [_LOD_SharedStashSave.sss](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/raw/main/_LOD_SharedStashSave.sss)  
Has an empty shared stash that has all named tabs for some *chefs kiss* organization

# Disclaimer
For all versions of the filter I take no responsibility for any items that are accidentally hidden and/or do not notify. I do try my best to test these filters and ensure they are working properly but there's always room for error.
